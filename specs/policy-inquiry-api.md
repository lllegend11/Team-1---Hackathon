# Policy Inquiry API — Steps 1 & 2

## Overview

The Policy Inquiry is the first exchange in the BD Change Process for producer changes on existing annuities. The **Receiving Broker/Dealer** submits a request through DTCC to the **Delivering Broker/Dealer**, asking for details on specific contracts held by a client. This is a single-client-per-request operation.

The Receiving Firm provides minimal identifying information — client name, SSN, and policy numbers — and receives back enriched policy details for each contract.

---

## Step 1 — Policy Inquiry Request

Submitted by the Receiving Broker/Dealer to DTCC.

**DTCC Status:** `MANIFEST_REQUESTED`

### Payload

```json
{
  "policyInquiryRequest": {
    "requestingFirm": {
      "firmName": null,
      "firmId": null,
      "servicingAgent": {
        "agentName": null,
        "npn": null
      }
    },
    "client": {
      "clientName": null,
      "ssn": null,
      "policyNumbers": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `requestingFirm.firmName` | string | Name of the receiving broker/dealer |
| `requestingFirm.firmId` | string | DTCC firm identifier |
| `requestingFirm.servicingAgent.agentName` | string | Name of the new servicing agent |
| `requestingFirm.servicingAgent.npn` | string | National Producer Number of the new agent |
| `client.clientName` | string | Full name of the client |
| `client.ssn` | string | Client's Social Security Number |
| `client.policyNumbers` | string[] | List of policy numbers to inquire about |

### Notes

- This is a **one client at a time** request.
- The delivering firm is not specified in the request — DTCC routes based on the policy numbers provided.
- The servicing agent information is included so the delivering firm and carrier are aware of the intended new agent from the outset.

## Step 2 — Policy Inquiry Response

Returned by the Delivering Broker/Dealer through DTCC to the Receiving Firm.

**DTCC Status:** `MANIFEST_RECEIVED`

### Payload

#### Policy Object

### Notes

- The `policies` array contains one entry per policy number submitted in the request, with `policyNumber` identifying each policy.
- The delivering firm information is **not** included in the response — DTCC is aware of the delivering firm but does not pass it back to the receiving firm.
- The response returns only the **last four digits** of the SSN for security.
- The `trailingCommission` field is a simple yes/no indicating whether the new servicing agent will receive trailing commissions on this policy.

## Sequence Context

This request/response pair covers Steps 1 and 2 of the broader BD Change Process. After the Receiving Firm reviews the returned policy details (Step 3 — Due Diligence), in-scope policies proceed to Step 4 where individual BD Change Requests are sent to each carrier for validation.
